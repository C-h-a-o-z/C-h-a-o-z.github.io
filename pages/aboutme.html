                    <p><b>The Basics</b></p>

                    Hi, my name is Brian Somers.
                    I was born on 11 August 2005.
                    I'm a beginner software developer.
                    But, I strive to eventually become a professional game developer
                    I'm currently in my second year of software development, and chose game design as subject since it was the closest to game development.
                    Currently, My interest and focus lie mainly in making 2D games, as it feels more rewarding to make.
                    However, I do want to learn how to make good 3d games, since I have a lot of personal game ideas that work better or only work in 3D.

                    <p><b>Why Game Development</b></p>

                    I've always been interested in games and the process behind them.
                    And so I decided to pursue my passion and learn coding.
                    I started off simple.
                    I played minecraft a lot at the time, and there was a mod trending that I really enjoyed (origins mod).
                    The developers made it easy to add new things to the mod and basically make your own classes with their own skills.
                    I wanted to give it a try, so I looked at what others made and copied one I liked.
                    Then I edited that to figure out what everything does.
                    After repeating that process for a little, I thought of something unique I wanted to add.
                    I then made my own class for the mod using my basic knowledge of the code and a few examples.
                    This worked really well, and I actually got it to work.
                    But I wasn't able to make some things naturally, and it was completely unbalanced.
                    After successfully making something myself with code, I realized how fun it was to do.
                    After this, I started thinking about making games myself, so I can add anything I want to it without using another game as a base.
                    I really liked the thought of that, so I began thinking about some Game ideas.
                    After that, my decision to become a game developer became final.
                    After finishing school, I got accepted in Sintlucas in the course Software Development at the age of (barely) 16.
                    We learned how to make Pong with C# in unity, and I really enjoyed making it.
                    It wasn't impressive or anything, but I really enjoyed the process behind it.
                    We also had to make a website later that year, but I didn't find it as fun as making games.
                    When we did work on games, I was really interested and re-used the same code as my previous games, and later I noticed a lot of ways to improve it.
                    When I noticed that, I realized how much I had improved, and I became even more interested.
                    I passed that year, and I'm currently in the second year

                    <p><b>What Do I Like About Coding</b></p>
                    
                    I like making something myself and fixing the bugs, slowly seeing a project grow and improve.
                    As well as having someone play my game and actually being interested in how I've made it.
                    Whenever someone else plays one of my games and tells me what they enjoy about it, it makes me feel proud that all the effort I put into a project managed to work out.
                    I also really enjoy playing/seeing other students games and seeing what they have done and how they tackled their issues.
                    Usually, I learn something new I could have added to my game, or I get inspired to make another game with this new knowledge/idea.
                    That's why I enjoy coding (games) so much.
                    It's an endless process of getting inspired by others to make something even better than before.
